### :bookmark: Table

As we all know, one table is composed of columns and rows, and each column might have one specific column name. Usually, the first row is called as **the Header** and each cell in the header saves one column name.

The syntax of creating a table is quiet easy.

```
| Column 1 | Column 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
|  Cell 1  |  Cell 2  |
```

We use any number of ```---``` to separate the header row and other rows. Between columns of each row, we only need to use just one ```|``` so that we can tell apart different columns.
