### :bookmark: Paragraph

We can just write any text to form a individual paragraph, and if we want to have two or more paragraphs, we need to use **one blank line** to separate paragraphs.

#### :bulb: Blank line

We can see the difference of wheather there is a blank line or not.

##### :mega: With a blank line

paragraph one

paragraph two

##### :mega: Without a blank line

paragraph one
paragraph two

#### :bulb: Indent

Notice that we can't add whitespaces or indent(tap) before one paragraph. Instead, we must use **```&nbsp;```** to create whitespaces or indent(tap). For example:

This paragraph have no whitespaces before itself.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paragraph have one indent(tap) (```1 tap = 4 &nbsp;```) before itself.
