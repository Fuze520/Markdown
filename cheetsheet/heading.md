### :bookmark: Headings(1)

In the first way of creating headings, we can create **6 different levels of headings** in Markdown. We use different numbers of **'#'** before titles to create different headings. For example, one **'#'** corresponds to level one heading, etc.

:bulb: **_Hint 1_:** One whitespace must be added after **'#'**.

:bulb: **_Hint 2_:** Blank lines should be added before and after a heading.

:bulb: **_Hint 3:_** Right after **level one heading** and **level two heading**, there will have one separate line.

# Level 1 Heading

### :bookmark: Headings(2)

In the second way of creating headings, we can create **2 different levels of headings** in Markdown. Only level one heading and level two heading can be created in this way. We can add any number of **'=='** for level one heading and add any number of **'--"** for level two heading.
